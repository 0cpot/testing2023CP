			<p> Tongariro was New Zealand's first national park. The mountain
peaks of Tongariro, Ngauruhoe and Ruapehu were a gift from Ngati
Tuwharetoa in 1887. This was 15 years after the world's first
national park, Yellowstone was created in the United States </p></div>

			<div class = "content_4"><p>National parks are places set aside to
			protect natural landscapes and native plants and animals forever
			They are really big - 10,000 hectares or more, Protection comes first
			but they are also places for people to enjoy. GO visit some of them-
			just dont damage them, We also have underwater national parks - they
			are called marine reserves</p></div>
